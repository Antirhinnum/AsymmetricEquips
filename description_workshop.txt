Ever wanted to wear just one eyepatch? Well now you can!

Certain items can now be worn asymmetrically, which is noted in their tooltips. Simply hold shift and control, then click the item.
Note that this can only be done when the item is equipped or in the player's inventory.

[b]Call Methods[/b]:
See [url=https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Expert-Cross-Mod-Content#call-aka-modcall-intermediate]Expert Cross Mod Content[/url] for how to use Mod.Call().

[b]AddEquip[/b]:
[code]mod.Call("AddEquip", EquipType equipType, int equipId, int newId = -1, PlayerSide side = PlayerSide.Right)[/code][list][*]equipType is the EquipType you'd like to add asymmetry for.
[*]equipId is the id of said equip.
[*]newId is what id to replace the equip with. This defaults to -1, which removes the equip. This is useful for items like the Molten Skull Rose: The player shouldn't stop wearing the skull when turned around, but they should lose the rose. See below for an example.
[*]side is which side of the player this equips appears on when the player is facing right. For 99% of equips, this is 1 (Right). HandsOff equips use 2 (Left). If your equip has both HandsOn and HandsOff, consider using AddGlove instead.
 [*]PlayerSide values: 0 (Both); 1 (Right); 2 (Left)
[*][b]Ex[/b]: Band of Regeneration: mod.Call("AddEquip", EquipType.HandsOn, ArmorIDs.HandOn.BandofRegeneration);
[*][b]Ex[/b]: Molten Skull Rose: mod.Call("AddEquip", EquipType.Face, ArmorIDs.Face.MoltenSkullRose, ArmorIDs.Face.LavaSkull, 1);[/list]
[b]AddGlove[/b]:
A simpler method specifically for adding gloves -- items that show up on both of the player's hands (HandsOn and HandsOff).
[code]mod.Call("AddGlove", int itemId)[/code][list][*]itemId is the ID of the glove item. This item must have both a HandsOn and HandsOff equip for this method to work.
[*][b]Ex[/b]: Titan Glove: mod.Call("AddGlove", ItemID.TitanGlove);[/list]
