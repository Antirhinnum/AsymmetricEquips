Ever wanted to wear just one eyepatch? Well now you can!

Certain items can now be worn asymmetrically, which is noted in their tooltips. Simply hold shift and control, then click the item.
Note that this can only be done when the item is equipped or in the player's inventory.

[b]Call Methods[/b]:
See [url=https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Expert-Cross-Mod-Content#call-aka-modcall-intermediate]Expert Cross Mod Content[/url] for how to use Mod.Call().
Unless mentioned otherwise, all call methods must be called before recipes are added -- PostSetupContent() works best.

[b]AddEquip[/b]:
[code]mod.Call("AddEquip", EquipType equipType, int equipId, int newId = -1, PlayerSide side = PlayerSide.Right)[/code][list][*]equipType is the EquipType you'd like to add asymmetry for.
[*]equipId is the id of said equip.
[*]newId is what id to replace the equip with. This defaults to -1, which removes the equip. This is useful for items like the Molten Skull Rose: The player shouldn't stop wearing the skull when turned around, but they should lose the rose. See below for an example.
[*]side is which side of the player this equips appears on when the player is facing right. For 99% of equips, this is 1 (Right). HandsOff equips use 2 (Left). If your equip has both HandsOn and HandsOff, consider using AddGlove instead.
 [*]PlayerSide values: 0 (Both); 1 (Right); 2 (Left)
[*][b]Ex[/b]: Band of Regeneration: mod.Call("AddEquip", EquipType.HandsOn, ArmorIDs.HandOn.BandofRegeneration);
[*][b]Ex[/b]: Molten Skull Rose: mod.Call("AddEquip", EquipType.Face, ArmorIDs.Face.MoltenSkullRose, ArmorIDs.Face.LavaSkull, 1);[/list]
[b]AddGlove[/b]:
A simpler method specifically for adding gloves -- items that show up on both of the player's hands (HandsOn and HandsOff).
[code]mod.Call("AddGlove", int itemId)[/code][list][*]itemId is the ID of the glove item. This item must have both a HandsOn and HandsOff equip for this method to work.
[*][b]Ex[/b]: Titan Glove: mod.Call("AddGlove", ItemID.TitanGlove);[/list]
[b]AddSpecialItem[/b]:
Marks an item type as asymmetric without requiring an equip slot. Intended to be used for items that have visual effects without using equip slots, like the eye effect of Yoraiz0r's Spell. Note that marking an item as asymmetric only allows it to change sides: You must handle the logic yourself using ItemOnFrontSide.
[code]mod.Call("AddSpecialItem", int itemId)[/code][list][*]itemId is the ID of the special item. This can be any number as long as it corresponds to an actual item.
[*][b]Ex[/b]: Yoraiz0r's Spell: mod.Call("AddSpecialItem", ItemID.Yoraiz0rWings);[/list]
[b]ItemOnFrontSide[/b]:
Able to be called whenever. Returns true if the item is on the player's front side or if the item isn't asymmetric, and returns false otherwise. Intended to be used in conjunction with AddSpecialItem to manually handle asymmetry.
[code]mod.Call("ItemOnFrontSide", Item item, Player player)[/code][list][*]item is the item being checked.
[*]player is the player on which item is equipped.
[*][b]Ex[/b] (in a ModItem's UpdateAccessory hook):[/list][code]if (asymmetricEquips.Call("ItemOnFrontSide", Item, player)) { player.GetModPlayer<CoolPlayer>().coolItemEquipped = true; }[/code]

[b]Missing Vanilla Equips (Sprites)[/b]
There are still some equips in vanilla [i]Terraria[/i] that should visually flip, but they need sprites, and I have no experience spriting.
If you would like to make any of these equips, feel free! I'll credit you in the mod's description.
The missing equips are as follows:[list][*]Normal, Jellyfish, and Arctic Diving Gears (snorkel)
[*]Black, Blue, and Maroon Graduation Caps (tassels)
[*]Magic, Stalker's, and Molten Quivers
[*]Normal and Lavaproof Tackle Bags
[*]Architect Gizmo Pack
[*]Apprentice's Scarf
[*]Toolbelt
[*]Queen Bee, Wall of Flesh, and Twins Masks
[*]Treasure Hunter Shirt (male variant)
[*]Shroomite Headgear
[*]Monk's Shirt
